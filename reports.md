Reports are classes that aggregate the data gathered by a rule and output it to a csv and json file. They run very quickly and therefore have no need to be cached.
    
There are three main types of reports: 
    
Repo: Repo reports aggregate data on things we care about across repos in the org.

Org: Reports on the organization the repos are found in.

Overall: Reports that output data about every repo based on the repo reports.
